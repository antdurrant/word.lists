\description{
A dataset containing the New Academic Word List (NAWL) & New General Service List (NGSL).
Difficulty groupings have been arbitrarily set by me, as follows:
Group 1: first 500 words of NGSL by frequency & "supplementary" words  - months/numbers etc
Group 2: next 500 words of NGSL by frequency
Group 3: next 1000 words of NGSL by frequency
Group 4: remaining NGSL words by frequency (about 800 words)
Group 5: academic word list (about 950 words)
