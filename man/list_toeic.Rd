}
\details{
Difficulty groupings have been arbitrarily set by me, as follows:
\itemize{
\item Group 1: first 500 words of NGSL by frequency & "supplementary" words  - months/numbers etc
\item Group 2: next 500 words of NGSL by frequency
\item Group 3: next 1000 words of NGSL by frequency
\item Group 4: remaining NGSL words by frequency (about 800 words)
\item Group 5: TOEIC (about 1250 words)
